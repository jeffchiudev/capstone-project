## üìñ About: 

### Description:

No longer just shared between nerdy friends at the lunch table, table top role playing gaming (TTRPG) is more popular than ever.  Games are streamed online, played online between friends all across the country, played between famous friends across the country and the access to materials has only grown in the digital marketspace.  Building your characters by hand, with pen and paper is time consuming even for the seasoned gaming veteran.

This has been simplified by character builders, both official (e.g. D&D Beyond for Dungeons & Dragons) and fan-made that translate the numbers and rules of building a character into a finalized sheet that is ready for play.  The inspiration for this project was that most of these projects lack animation or graphics.  Decisions made in the charcter creation process (or changed as characters level up or acquire items) end up becoming a line of text in the character sheet to be referenced mid-game. 

By contrast we have mainstream AAA developed, RPG videogames where items tend to reside in inventory that are rendered and after being selected can be clicked on, and moved to a inventory space on a character where the stats of the character will be changed and in most cases the appearance of the character model will change as the piece of armor/item will appear on the body of the model.  

This is important for the visual medium of video games and less so for the imaginary playspace of a TTRPG.  However I believe there can be a happy compromise that adds visual elements that at least gives the player a better idea of what they're changing on their player character as they play.
